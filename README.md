Program description:

Air Duel is based on an old game that my friend told me about and I actually 
have never played the game myself. So, I'm not quite sure how close these 
two are, though. 

It is very simple to play this game. You can either choose a P-51 Mustang or
A6M Zero for your plane. And the objective of the game is just to shoot down your
opponent! Each plane takes diffenent amount of damage, i.e. P-51 can sustain 
2-3 direct shots while Zero can sustain only 1-2 direct shots. Also fighter will 
stall if you do a stiff climb. You are given 4 lives.

Initially you are given 30 bullets (plenty for most of the time) and you can 
get extra 10 more bullets if you shoot down the balloon. The balloon will 
appear only once in a match. A match ends if you or your opponent gets shoot
down or crash, or if both of you crash. Note that your plane will not collide
with another plane or any other object in the sky. After testing it with
collision, we found that it is best played without collision. 

Main Menu Screen:

After you have seen the title and credits screen you will be presented with
a menu on the screen. You can move the flashing box with Up and Down arrow
keys to move between different option 'bars'. You can change an option by
pressing 'Spacebar' when the flashing box is on the option bar you want.

You can choose your plane type, computer level, sound on/off, or exit to DOS.
After you have chosen your plane and opponent's, you can then click on the
bottom bar 'Take Off' to start the game. After either you or your opponent 
have been shoot down 4 times, you should see the main menu again. 

Player 1 is the player on the left side of the screen and Player 2 is the one
on the opposite side.

Plane controls are as follows:

Player 1:  Increase Speed -----------> 'I'
           Decrease Speed -----------> 'M'
           Change heading to Right --> 'L'
           Change heading to Left ---> 'J'

           Fire machine gun ---------> Space Bar or '`'

Player 2:  Increase Speed -----------> Up arrow
           Decrease Speed -----------> Down arrow
           Change heading to Right --> Right arrow
           Change heading to Left ---> Left arrow

           Fire machine gun ---------> Return or Enter key

General Control:

 Start a rematch or set up the planes -> 'R'
 Exit to DOS --------------------------> 'ESC'
